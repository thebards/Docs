## Problems Solved

This protocol aims to address key issues in the current digital economy by implementing curation for value capture, fractal structure for economic distribution, and smart contracts for automated management. The following are some of the problems that this protocol may solve:

Value discovery and evaluation: Through curation mechanisms, users can vote and evaluate content, projects, or other digital assets. This helps to discover and promote high-quality resources and provide incentives for creators and contributors.

Decentralized distribution: By using a fractal structure to distribute economic value, the protocol can avoid the concentration of power and unfair distribution in traditional centralized models. The fractal structure disperses economic value across multiple levels, achieving a more fair and transparent distribution.

Smart contract automation: By deploying smart contracts on the blockchain, this protocol can achieve automated management and execution. Smart contracts can help ensure the fairness and transparency of the protocol, preventing malicious behavior and manipulation.

Reducing costs and increasing efficiency: Based on blockchain technology, smart contracts can be executed in a decentralized environment, reducing intermediary costs. In addition, the design of curation and fractal structures helps to improve the efficiency of resource allocation and value evaluation.

Incentivizing participation and innovation: By providing voting, evaluation, and economic incentives to users, this protocol encourages active participation in the digital economy ecosystem. This will help to drive innovation and resource optimization, thereby increasing the value of the entire system.

In summary, by combining curation, fractal structure, and smart contracts, this protocol aims to address issues of value discovery, distribution, and management in the digital economy, working towards a more fair, transparent, and efficient digital economy ecosystem.
